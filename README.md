# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game can be played by two players, X and O.

**How to Play**
To play the game, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The game will start, and the players will take turns clicking on the buttons to place their marks.

To make a move, the player should click on an empty button. The game will automatically switch between X and O after each move.

**Features**
The game has a 3x3 grid, where players can place their marks.
The game checks for a winner after each move.
If a player wins, a message will appear announcing the winner.
The game has a "New Game" button to start a new game.
The game has a "Reset Game" button to reset the current game.

**Code Structure**
The code is structured into three files:

index.html: The HTML file that contains the game interface.
style.css: The CSS file that styles the game interface.
app.js: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic.
